When the screen is resized to below 550px we see the webpage reformat to produce a more user friendly experience for those who are using mobile devices. This takes the form of a single column of content where previously there had been two or three columns in different sectors of the webpage. Similarly the hero image changes to one which is more easily understood in such a small display and the format of the text and image layout changes. This occurs due to clever code in the skeleton code base which tells the browser to reformat once the screen size is changed either side of the 550px limit. The css done is written with the smaller browser in the foreground as these devices usually have less processing power and therefore benefit from having less code to process to reach a result that works for their screen size. Then code is written to encompass anything that goes beyond the 550pc screen size -these devices have enough processing power to sift through the mobile device friendly code before reaching the relevant code for their operating system - all the while maintaining high refresh rates. These sections of code which effect different devices are called media queries and multiple can be included in a single stylesheet. For anything over a certain number of pixles in width, there is a set of styles which are implemented to optimise the website for that display.
